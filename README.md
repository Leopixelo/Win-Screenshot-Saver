# Win-Screenshot-Saver
Its a Script, you can let run in the background and every time, you make a screenshot with the PrintScreen Key or with the Win+Shift+S Shortcut, it will save the image in your Pictures/Screenshots/ Folder with the current timestamp as the name.

Run it with pythonw.exe to avoid a command prompt and let it stay in the background.

I used the Windows Task Scheduler to automatically run the Script when I unlock my computer.

# Installation
## Windows
To create a Task to start the Program every time, you log in or unlock your account, run the ```copy.bat``` and grand the request for elevated permissions.
