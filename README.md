# Win-Screenshot-Saver
Its a Script, you can let run in the background an every time, you make a screenshot with the PrintScreen Key or with the Win+Shift+S Scortcut, it will save the image in your Pictures/Screenshots/ Folder with the current timestamp as the name.

Run it with pythonw.exe to avoid a command prompt and let it stay in the background.

I used the Windows Task Scheduler to automaticly run the Script when i unlock my computer.
